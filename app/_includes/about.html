        <p style="display: inline-block; margin: 3 15px; vertical-align: top;">I am a multidisciplinary engineer and designer with a passion for user-centric web application development. My strong background in both the technical and visual aspects of application building enables me to create elegant interfaces that address real user problems while balancing performance and functionality.</p>
        <p style="display: inline-block; margin: 3 15px; vertical-align: top;">My work history primarily involves back-end development, including web applications, APIs, and system integration. Recently, I have been expanding my expertise to mobile applications (both iOS and Android) and front-end design.</p>
        <p style="display: inline-block; margin: 3 15px; vertical-align: top;">Beautiful and logical design stems from building for the user while balancing the necessary constraints that arise during the development process. In any project, I aim to reconcile these two aspects by serving as a communication bridge between engineers and designers or by working in both capacities simultaneously.</p>
